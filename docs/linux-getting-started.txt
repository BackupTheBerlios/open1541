= Getting Started with open1541 on Linux =
==========================================

by Thomas Giesel

This document describes how to set up an environment to build the open1541
software on Linux.

Requirements
============

If you want to compile open1541, your system has to meet following requirements:

- A Linux environment
- GNU Make version 3.81 or higher
- A native GCC to compile tools
- An arm-elf toolchain
  - See below

Building the Toolchain
======================

If you don't have a suitable toolchain for arm-elf, you can build one using a
Makefile enclosed to open1541:

- cd open1541/scripts/toolchain
- run following command:
  make
  - this will download all source files needed and compile the tools
  - it will take a while, maybe more than one hour
  - all tools will be installed in a separate directory 
    /opt/arm-elf-binutils-2.18.50-gcc-4.3.0
    to avoid any interference with existing tools

Now you can continue with docs/compile-open1541.txt
