Single Step Mode
================

In this mode the emulation still takes place in the FIQ. But unless in the
normal mode the timer IRQ is not set anymore, so the CPU emulation stops
after each instruction.

The single step mode is active if MOS6502_S_BIT is set in m_pc.

To enable the single step mode call mos6502_stop. To exit from single step 
mode call mos6502_cont. Call mos6502_step to execute one instruction.
