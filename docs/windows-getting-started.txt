============================================
= Getting Started with open1541 on Windows =
============================================

by Thomas Giesel

This document describes how to set up an environment to build the open1541
software on Windows.

The method described in this document does not use Cygwin, but a much simpler
MinGW based toolchain.

1. Install MinGW and MSYS
=========================

MinGW, a contraction of "Minimalist GNU for Windows", is a port of the
GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), and GNU Binutils, for use in the development of
native Microsoft Windows applications.

MSYS is a collection of GNU utilities such as bash, make and grep to allow
building of applications and programs which depend on traditionally UNIX tools
to be present. It is intended to supplement MinGW and the deficiencies of the
cmd shell.

First install http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MinGW-5.1.4.exe
If you have no experience with this software yet, I strongly recommend to use
the default installation settings, so just click "Next" several times...

Then install http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.10.exe

You can use the default install settings. After the installation, a script will
be started to set up some things.
- Allow it to run with "y"
- When it askes wether you have MinGW installed, answer "y"
- Enter the path where MinGW has been installed "C:/MinGW"

I recommend to have a look at these two files to get an idea about what you
just installed:
- C:\msys\1.0\doc\msys\MSYS_WELCOME.rtf
- C:\msys\1.0\doc\msys\README.rtf

2. Install YAGARTO
==================

Now we need a compiler for ARM.

Go to http://www.yagarto.de/ and download the "YAGARTO GNU ARM toolchain".
You don't need any other packets from this site. Install it with the default
settings.

3. Install Mercurial
====================

To automatically download the latest open1541 sources (or maybe even to join
the development), you need the Mercurial version control system.

Get the latest release version from http://mercurial.berkwood.com/.
Install it.

4. Install Flash Magic
======================

If you want to write the software you built to the LPC's flash directly using
make, you should install Flash Magic.

Go to http://www.flashmagictool.com/ and download the tool. Install it.

5. Restart Windows
==================

To be sure all PATHs are set, restart Windows.

6. Get the open1541 sources
===========================

- Open the msys shell (rxvt)
    Start => Programs => MinGW => MSYS => msys

rxvt uses the traditional Linux-way of copy & paste:
- Marking text in the rxvt window using the mouse copies it to the clipboard
  automatically (no <Ctrl>+C)
- Paste from the clipboard by using the middle mouse button
- Alternatively you can use <Shift>+<Insert> to insert text

- Copy following line to the shell:
    hg clone http://hg.berlios.de/repos/open1541
- Now the sources should appear in your home directory, e.g.:
  c:\msys\1.0\home\skoe
  this is seen in the msys shell as:
  /home/skoe
  (type "pwd" to see you working directory if you are lost)
- Change to there:
  cd open1541

Now you can continue with docs/compile-open1541.txt
