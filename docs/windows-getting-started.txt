= Getting Started with open1541 on Windows =
============================================

by Thomas Giesel

This document describes how to set up an environment to build the open1541
software on Windows.

1. Install Cygwin
=================

Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows. You can use this environment
to set up all tools we need to build open1541.

You need two directories: <archive>=C:\cygwin-install and <install>=C:\cygwin.
<archive> can be anywhere, <install> should remain at this place to keep it
simple. If you put it on another drive, adjust all paths in this manual which 
refer to "C:\cygwin" or "/cygdrive/c"

Depending on what we're going to do later you should have at least 1 GB free on
<install>.

If you have Cygwin installed already, check the Install Cygwin section 
nevertheless to make sure you have recent versions of all packages needed.

You can use a windows text editor to edit some files, make sure to use one which
detects Unix line endings, e.g. PSPad, Programmers Notepad or ConTEXT. We will
also install Mined, a quite comfortable command line editor with a Menu that
is quite similar to many windows programs, e.g. <Alt>+<F> opens the file menu.

So, let's go:

- Download setup.exe from www.cygwin.com ("Install or update now!")
- Save it to <archive>
- Start it, "Next", "Install from Internet"
- Enter your root directory <install>, leave the rest at "RECOMMENDED", "Next"
- Enter Local Package Directory <archive>, "Next", "Next"
- Select a mirror
- Install packages
  - Click on View => Full to see a flat list
  - To select a packege, click on "Skip" at the corresponding line
  - Clicking several times selects different versions, take the highest
  - Selecting a package may automatically select other dependencies
  - Packages we need:
    - gcc
    - git
    - libgmp-devel   >= 4.2
    - libmpfr-devel  >= 3.2.0
    - make           >= 1.81
    - mined
    - open-ssh
    - rxvt
    - subversion
    - util-linux
    - wget
- "Next" to start
- When complete: check the icons you need, finish the installation

2. Make Cygwin more usable
==========================

We don't want our home directory to reside in a path with spaces, since some 
tools don't handle them correctly. New versions of Cygwin let it point to places
like "Documents and Settings", so let's change it:

- Make a backup of C:\cygwin\etc\passwd
- Open C:\cygwin\etc\passwd in your favourite windows text editor
  - One of the lines (most likely the last one) is your normal user account
  - Between the last two colons there is the path of your home directory,
    if it points to somewhere else, change it to a path like this:
    /home/yourname
  - Make sure you didn't change any other field and save the file

Next, we set up a terminal which has a look & feel similar to putty instead
of the standard DOS box running bash:

- In Windows Explorer go to  C:\cygwin\bin, right-click on rxvt.exe
  - Send To -> Desktop (create shortcut)
  - Now right-click on the new shortcut on the desktop
  - Choose properties, shortcut and change the target to:
  C:\cygwin\bin\rxvt.exe -sl 800 -fn "Lucida Console-12" -sr -e bash --login -i

Now you should be able to start a cygwin bash shell by clicking the rxvt icon
on the desktop. Do some basic tests:
  - The command "pwd" should output "/home/yourname"
  - The command "gcc" should output "No input files"

2a. Some hints for bash and rxvt
================================

Beginners often forget that they can use a command line completion. This can
speed up the command line usage significantly. The tab key can be used for this,
press it twice if there are more than one possibility.
Let's try it:
- type following letters and the Tab key at the places:
    mine<Tab> /et<Tab>/term<Tab> <Enter>
  - will be completed to:
    mined.exe /etc/termcap
  - Press <Alt>+<F> and Q <Enter> to leave this editor.

Mrxvt uses the traditional Linux-way of copy & paste:
- Marking text in the rxvt window using the mouse copies it to the clipboard
  automatically (no <Ctrl>+C)
- Paste from the clipboard by using the middle mouse button
- Alternatively you can use <Shift>+<Insert> to insert text

3. Getting the open1541 sources
===============================

- Open a bash shell (rxvt)
- Copy following line
  git clone git://git.berlios.de/open1541
- Now the sources should appear in you home directory/open1541
  (type "pwd" to see you working directory if you are lost)
- Change to there:
  cd open1541

4. Building the Toolchain
=========================

- cd open1541/scripts/toolchain
  - remember that you can use auto-completion by pressing <Tab> once or twice
- run following command:
  make
  - this will download all source files needed and compile the tools
  - it will take a while, maybe more than one hour
  - all tools will be installed in a separate directory 
    /opt/arm-elf-binutils-2.18.50-gcc-4.3.0
    to avoid any interference with existing tools

Now you can continue with docs/compile-open1541.txt
